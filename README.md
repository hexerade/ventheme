# ventheme
discord theme for myself. trying to get it on github so it'll work with my vencord client online (that runs of userscript so local stuff like uplaoded css doesn't work. still refusing to download chrome to make it easier, though.)
i dont know what im doing otherwise

site i used to make it:
https://bdeditor.dev/theme/frostedglass
